    Limitations of Linear Data Structures:
        --  The primary limitation of linear data structures is that they cannot naturally represent hierarchical or branching relationships, as each 
            element is limited to exactly one predecessor and one successor.
        --  They do not provide optimal solution when the elements are characterized by a one-to-many relationship.

    Introduction to Trees:

        A tree is a non-linear data structure that represents relationships and connections among various elements, facilitating easy navigation and search.
        The primary purpose of a tree is efficient data organization.

        In a tree, nodes are the individual elements, and edges connect these nodes.
